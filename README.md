# Advent of Code 2023

I just finished reading the second edition of [The AWK Programming
Language](https://awk.dev/), so I'm going to do as many of this year's puzzles
as I can in awk. In addition to the solutions here, I'll be uploading daily
explanations to [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@bwestbro).

## Day 1

I'm somewhat ashamed to admit this, but I got stuck for a while on part 2 and
needed a tip [from reddit][reddit1] to get unstuck. I don't want to spoil
anything here, but if you're getting the answer for the sample input but not
your puzzle input, you might need the hint given in this post. I don't feel that
bad about it because it's basically a clarification of the instructions, not a
programming hint.

## Day 2

Today felt much more approachable, just some straightforward string splitting
and a few regular expressions. Perfect for awk!
