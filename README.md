# Advent of Code 2023

I just finished reading the second edition of [The AWK Programming
Language](https://awk.dev/), so I'm going to do as many of this year's puzzles
as I can in awk. In addition to the solutions here, I'll be uploading daily
explanations to [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@bwestbro).
